# signlanguagerecognition
Implementation of object_detection with tensorflow/models, Python and OpenCV.
In this sign language recognition project, we create a sign detector, which detects basic greeting gestures that can very easily be extended to cover a vast multitude of other signs and hand gestures including the alphabets.

We have developed this project using OpenCV and Keras modules of python.
